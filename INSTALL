  CPAN: File::HomeDir loaded ok (v0.80)

  cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.9205)
  ReadLine support enabled

  cpan[1]> install GD

  ...

  cpan[2]> install Image::Resize

  ...

  cpan[3]> quit

First you maybe need the libgd 2.0.28 (http://www.libgd.org/) to install the GD module (read the README file of GD to get further informations).




INSTALL jpgresize:

To install the script and man pages in the standard areas, 
give the sequence of commands

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Maybe you want to run a verbose test. Instead of `make test`
you have to use `make test TEST_VERBOSE=1`.

If you want to install the script in your own private space, use

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/private/perllib \
       INSTALLMAN1DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man1 \
       INSTALLMAN3DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man3      
  make
  make test
  make install

If you want to install in a testarea, use

  perl Makefile.PL DESTDIR=/my/testarea/
  make
  make test
  make install

Any libraries installed in such non-standard places may then
need to have the appropriate path to them specified in the script.

Note that `make test` may not necessarily be enabled.
